# ADR 0001: Monorepo Orchestration with Nx

## Status
Approved

## Date
2026-05-08

## Context
Managing multiple related applications (API, Web, shared libraries) as isolated repositories causes friction: duplicated CI/CD configs, version drift between shared code, and complex local setups. A monorepo strategy is required to keep all artifacts in a single, coherent codebase.

## Decision
Adopt **Nx** as the monorepo orchestration tool, combined with **npm workspaces** for native package resolution.

- All applications reside under `apps/`.
- All shared libraries reside under `libs/`.
- Nx task pipeline (`nx.json`) defines build, test, and lint dependency graphs for intelligent caching and parallel execution.
- `eslint-plugin-boundaries` enforces strict import rules between layers and workspaces.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Unified CI/CD pipeline — one lock file, one lint config, one test runner.
- Nx Computation Cache keeps CI under 1 minute for unchanged projects.
- `dependency-cruiser` enforces hexagonal layer rules globally across all packages.

### Negative
- Developers must learn Nx CLI conventions.
- Large repositories can be slower to clone without sparse checkout configuration.
