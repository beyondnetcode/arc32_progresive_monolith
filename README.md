# 🏢 User Management System (UMS) - Enterprise Monorepo

Welcome to the **User Management System (UMS)**, a highly resilient, enterprise-grade modular monolith built for **UMS**. This system is engineered to manage corporate identities, access control, and user lifecycles across the organization.

The UMS is built leveraging the **BMAD Method**, enforcing strict **Clean Architecture (Hexagonal)** principles, $0-cost observability (AOP), and rigorous CI/CD quality gates. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Progressive Design Disclaimer**: This repository serves as a reference base for 100% Node.js-based systems. While currently implemented as a single modular monolithic solution (UMS), the frontend architecture is built to preserve its structure as a unified entry portal. In the future, it will scale to integrate other corporate backends (such as TMS, WMS, etc.), which will be developed as independent, isolated services with their own databases. Communication will be routed through a central API Gateway, using the Backend For Frontend (BFF) pattern to optimize payloads for web and mobile clients (see [ADR 0008](./ums-workspace/docs/architecture-design/adrs/0008-progressive-multimodule-evolution-gateway-bff.md)).


## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS (v10), TypeORM, PostgreSQL 16.
- **Frontend**: React (v18), Vite, Zustand, TanStack React Query.
- **Monorepo Orchestration**: Nx & npm Workspaces.
- **Security & Quality**: Husky, ESLint (SonarJS + Boundaries), CodeQL, GitHub Actions.
