# ðŸ“Š Design Maturity & Patterns Evaluation ”” Microservices & Progressive Evolution

This document presents a rigorous evaluation of international **Microservices Patterns and Anti-patterns** measured against our current progressive monolithic architectural design. It serves as a strategic guide to de-risk the long-term technical evolution.

## âš–ï¸ 1. Global Pattern Maturity Matrix

This matrix rates our current infrastructure and design readiness against standard enterprise patterns.

| Pattern Cluster | Specific Pattern | Applicability to Current Stack | Maturity / Risk Score | Implementation Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integration** | **Strangler Fig** | **Critical Core** | ðŸŸ¢ 100% Ready | The foundational strategy of the architecture. Modules are logically isolated for incremental microservice splitting without service downtime. |
| **Composition** | **BFF (Backend for Frontend)** | **Core Mandatory** | ðŸŸ¢ 100% Adopted | Officially implemented via specialized NestJS layers per device ([ADR-0008](../../../architecture/adrs/nodejs/0008-progressive-multimodule-evolution-gateway-bff.md)). Prevents cross-channel pollution. |
| **Reliability** | **Circuit Breaker** | **Operational** | ðŸŸ¢ 100% Adopted | Implemented via **Distributed Circuit Breakers** sharing state via Redis ([ADR-0011](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0011-fault-tolerance-resiliency-patterns.md)) combined with active upstream healthcheck monitoring at Kong Ingress Edge. |
| **Database** | **Schema Per Context** | **Core Mandatory** | ðŸŸ¢ 100% Adopted | Solves coupling from day one. Prevents raw SQL join poisoning across domains ([ADR-0031](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0031-schema-per-context-domain-event-catalog.md)). Zero-refactor DB portability. |
| **Scalability** | **CQRS (Basic)** | **Optional** | ðŸŸ¡ Roadmap | Enabled for implementation as read-models only when database write contention explicitly demands it. |
| **Consistency** | **Saga Pattern** | **Distributed Future** | ðŸŸ¡ Roadmap | Formal strategy established for exclusive use from Phase 3 onwards, handling transactions across distributed microservices. |
| **Messaging** | **Transactional Outbox** | **Phase 2+** | ðŸŸ¡ Roadmap | Ensures atomic consistency between DB state and event forwarding when asynchronous integration scale is achieved. |

**Score Legend:**
*   ðŸŸ¢ **Adopted**: Fully designed, verified in specs, zero configuration changes required.
*   ðŸŸ¡ **Roadmap**: Infrastructure handles it natively, implementation depends on future module complexity.
*   ðŸ”´ **Incompatible**: Blocked by current infrastructure choice (None currently identified).

## ðŸš« 2. Critical Anti-Patterns and Preventive Immunization

Our architecture intentionally deploys specific "antibodies" to guarantee we don't devolve into traditional legacy architectures.

### 2.1 The "Distributed Monolith" Anti-pattern
Coupling separate components over the network where one down node halts the entire chain.

| Field | Definition & Impact Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Criticality** | ðŸ”´ **EXTREME** (Paralyzes scalability and reliability simultaneously) |
| **Concrete Example** | The Inventory module synchronously HTTP calls the Email module inside a checkout loop. The SMTP relay lags, causing total checkout timeouts for all users. |
| **Production Impact** | A single localized bug in a non-critical service cascades backward, killing the primary revenue stream. Total application blackout. |
| **Operational Risks** | Exponential growth in mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR). Developers cannot deploy one service independently of the other. |
| **Immunization Defense** | **[ADR-0015](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0015-event-driven-architecture-intra-domain.md) (Injectable Bus)** + **[ADR-0002](../../../architecture/adrs/nodejs/0002-clean-architecture-nestjs.md) (Hexagonal)**. Operations happen asynchronously via event fire-and-forget. If the secondary service dies, the message waits safely in RabbitMQ while the primary completes instantly. |

---

### 2.2 The "Shared Database Entanglement" Anti-pattern
Bypassing service APIs to run direct SQL joins across private data owned by another context.

| Field | Definition & Impact Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Criticality** | ðŸ”´ **VERY HIGH** (Permanent architectural lock-in) |
| **Concrete Example** | Reporting queries `SELECT * FROM users JOIN orders` directly. Team A alters the `users` table column name, instantly breaking Team B's Order system in production. |
| **Production Impact** | "Change Paralysis". Modifying a simple database column requires coordinated downtime and simultaneous deploys across 5 different dev teams. |
| **Operational Risks** | Data corruption, leaking unauthorized tenant data, complete inability to extract microservices to their own physical hardware. |
| **Immunization Defense** | **[ADR-0031](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0031-schema-per-context-domain-event-catalog.md) (Isolated PostgreSQL Schema)**. Cross-schema SQL joins are physically blocked. Data communication MUST pass through official Domain APIs or Eventual-Consistent Projections. |

---

### 2.3 The "Fat Controller / Smart Pipe" Anti-pattern
Leaking vital business validation or orchestration rules into the API gateway (Kong) or message queues.

| Field | Definition & Impact Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Criticality** | ðŸŸ  **HIGH** (Degrades maintainability and testing) |
| **Concrete Example** | Writing 500 lines of custom Lua code inside Kong to validate dynamic discounts, or hardcoding workflow logic inside RabbitMQ binding keys. |
| **Production Impact** | Logic becomes untestable by standard CI/CD units. "Invisible bugs" appear in production that do not replicate in local engineer development environments. |
| **Operational Risks** | Vendor lock-in (locking logic to Kong-specific Lua). Infrastructure engineers accidentally overwrite business logic during server patches. |
| **Immunization Defense** | **Dumb Pipes / Smart Endpoints Strategy**. Kong only executes agnostic policies (JWT, SSL, Rate Limit). All business decisions MUST live inside the Typescript Application Hexagon where they are Jest-tested. |

---

### 2.4 The "Log Shards" (Blindness) Anti-pattern
Generating uncoordinated console logs across pods with no centralized identifier correlation.

| Field | Definition & Impact Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Criticality** | ðŸŸ  **HIGH** (Paralyzes SRE debugging capabilities) |
| **Concrete Example** | A high-value customer reports error "500 - ID XJ92". SRE checks Kong logs, BFF logs, and Core API logs independently and cannot tell which exact SQL query triggered that specific user failure. |
| **Production Impact** | Average troubleshooting time skyrockets from 5 minutes to 4 hours. Engineers must "grep" scattered text files trying to reconstruct history manually. |
| **Operational Risks** | High burnout of support staff, lost customer trust due to extremely slow reaction times to severe outages. |
| **Immunization Defense** | **[ADR-0007](../../../architecture/adrs/nodejs/0007-observability-telemetry-loki-opentelemetry.md) (OTel Distributed Tracing)**. A single `TraceParent ID` travels from the request inception to the DB response. Entering that ID into Jaeger displays the complete tree-map timeline instantly. |

## ðŸš€ 3. Final Maturity & Risk Assessment

### ðŸ›¡ï¸ Resiliency Strength: **HIGH**
*   The insertion of native **Circuit Breakers ([ADR-0011](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0011-fault-tolerance-resiliency-patterns.md))** and the strict contract testing regime shields the backend from total failure if external systems collapse.
*   **Dual-Layer Isolation ([ADR-0010](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0010-multi-tenancy-architecture-strategy.md))** creates mathematically provable security containment for Multi-Tenancy.

### âš¡ Performance Overhead: **LOW/OPTIMIZED**
*   **4-Tier Caching** (Client -> CDN -> BFF -> Core) handles read intensity intelligently before reaching raw disk.
*   gRPC implementation for heavy internal backbones prevents the overhead of JSON/HTTP negotiation cascades.

### ðŸš§ Remaining Risks / Immediate Action Recommendations
The remaining operational risks are now formally governed and zeroed-out through mandated framework controls:
1.  **Formalized Chaos & Load Injection**: Performance regressions and concurrency races are now captured via automated **Weekly K6 Snapshots** ([ADR-0037](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0037-performance-concurrency-chaos-strategy.md)).
2.  **Contract Testing Enforcement**: Safety during progressive microservice extraction is mathematically guaranteed via **Pact JS CI verification** mandated by [ADR-0037](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0037-performance-concurrency-chaos-strategy.md).
