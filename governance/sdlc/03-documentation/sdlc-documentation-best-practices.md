# ðŸ“š Best Practices for SDLC Documentation

> ðŸŒ **Bilingual Navigation:** [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Versión en Espaí±ol](../../sdlc-es/03-documentation/sdlc-documentation-best-practices.md)

This policy dictates how architectural and technical knowledge MUST mature alongside code deliverables across all lifecycle phases from MVP to production.

---

## ðŸ† 1. Key Objectives
To prevent "documentation rot" (stale information) and maintain a single, authoritative, version-controlled truth for the entire engineering ecosystem.

---

## ðŸ› ï¸ 2. Strategic Core Standards

### ðŸ“¦ A. Documentation as Code
Treat documentation exactly like production code. 
*   Store narrative content as Markdown alongside application code.
*   Use standard Git Version Control for auditing and diff history.
*   Subject docs to code reviews (Pull Requests) to ensure factual accuracy.

### ðŸ”„ B. Synchronized Lifecycle & Versioning
Documents must mature exactly synchronously with functionality increments.
*   **Rule:** No feature code should merge into stable branches without its delta documentation update.
*   Documentation state MUST be mapped to Release Git Tags (e.g., v1.2.0 docs reflect exactly v1.2.0 software mechanics).

### ðŸŒ± C. Incremental Maturity (Evolution)
Do not aim for exhaustive detail on Day 1.
*   **Phase 1 (MVP):** Maintain high-level, atomic READMEs that only block core engineering comprehension.
*   **Phase 2+ (Scale):** Expand tutorials, deeper conceptual maps, and detailed failure-mode diagrams iteratively.

### ðŸ¤– D. Automation First (Auto-Gen)
Maximize non-human artifact updating to ensure reliability.
*   Expose live API schemas directly from codebase metadata (Swagger/OpenAPI).
*   Leverage Mermaid.js markup language for diagrams directly inside markdown to support visual tracking without binaries.

## ðŸ” 3. Feedback & Clean-Up Lifecycle

1.  **Continuous Feedback:** Every published page MUST invite corrections via simple ticket creation if details appear ambiguous.
2.  **Obsolescence Audit:** During the sunsetting or deprecation of any microservice or feature, an explicit sub-task MUST trigger the deletion of expired documentation to clear ambient noise.
