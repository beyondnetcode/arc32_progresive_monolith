# 🏛️ Software Architecture Design Document (UMS)

This document details the formal system design specification for the **`ums-workspace`** monorepo. It adopts the **C4 Model** software modeling standard (Level 1: System Context, Level 2: Containers, Level 3: Components) and presents the unified and audited technical inventory of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Engineering Standards Mandate:** All architectural decisions described here are strictly governed by the **[Global Engineering Standards & BMAD Manifesto](../04-artifacts/engineering-standards.md)**. Principles like SOLID, Clean Architecture, optional DDD, and the avoidance of anti-patterns are mandatory and automatically enforced via CI/CD pipelines.

## 🎯 1. Architectural Deliverables & Requirements Baseline

The following table defines the mandatory deliverables, strategic scope, and contractual design requirements governing the software architecture of this monorepo:

| Priority | Deliverable | Description (Strategic Level – Executive Rationale) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Bounded Context Map | Representation of the bounded contexts of the SCM domain, their responsibilities, how they relate, and how they will evolve. Establishes a clear functional scope for teams and budgeting. |
| **2** | Platform Core Definition | Strategy that identifies cross-cutting capabilities (Identity, Master Data, Event Bus, API Gateway), their common purpose, and reuse principles. Justifies investments in shared components. |
| **3** | C4 Diagram (Context, Container, Component) | Architectural vision at levels 1 and 2: external systems, large containers, and communication between them. Sizes technical complexity and allows estimating effort without detailing classes or internal components. |
| **4** | Database Strategy | Substantiates the choice of persistence pattern (Database-per-Module), guidelines for distributed transactions, and general backup and recovery policies. Details the impact on costs and operations. |
| **5** | Event Domain Model (Event Storming) | Map of relevant business events, their producers, and consumers, along with delivery and ordering principles. Guides integration and the effort associated with orchestration/choreography. |
| **6** | End-to-End Observability Strategy | Approach to distributed telemetry: traceability of complete business processes, key metrics, and logging models at the architectural level. Used to estimate monitoring tools and costs. |
| **7** | Identity & Authorization Design | Strategy for the identity and authorization model: Identity Provider (IdP), authentication flow between contexts, and session guidelines. Helps size security across all domains. |
| **8** | Documented Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) | Definition of measurable non-functional requirements that condition the architecture: latency, throughput, availability, and graceful degradation mechanisms. Represents contractual targets that the design must meet. |
| **9** | Master Data Management Strategy | Work plan for master data: key entities, migration approach from SAP, quality guidelines, and phases. Justifies the integration and data cleansing effort in the budget. |
| **10** | API Versioning & Evolution Strategy | Guidelines for contract evolution (APIs and events): how changes are introduced without breaking dependencies. Forecasts technical governance and the cost of maintaining compatibility. |
| **11** | Multi-Domain Synchronization Strategy | Approach to eventual consistency between contexts: definition of sources of truth, duplication guidelines, and conflict resolution. Reveals integration complexity and its impact on timelines. |
| **12** | Initial Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | Log of the most influential architectural decisions, their justification, and alternatives. Backs up why a specific path was chosen, clarifying risks and assumed costs. |
| **13** | Integration Contract Testing Plan | Strategy to ensure interactions between contexts comply with their contracts, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Justifies quality assurance in integrations without detailing specific tools. |
| **14** | Deployment Infrastructure | Layout of the topology (cloud/on-premise/hybrid), key managed services, and operational cost estimations. Provides a financial and technical baseline for sizing. |
| **15** | Work Breakdown Structure & Plan | Roadmap with phases, sprints, profiles, milestones, and acceptance criteria. Translates strategy into a schedule and justifies workload and costs for each stage. |

## 🗺️ 2. C4 Model

The architectural design of UMS is modeled at three progressive levels of abstraction to align business vision with physical code implementation.

### Level 1: System Context Diagram
Defines the boundary of the User Management System (UMS) interacting with corporate users and external identity services.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User["Multi-Tenant Users (Tenant Staff)"]
    UMS["UMS and SaaS Gateway (API Gateway and BFF)"]
    ExternalAuth["External Identity Service (OAuth / Tenant IdP)"]
    Downstream["Downstream SaaS Services (TMS, WMS, etc.)"]

    User -->|Logs in / Accesses Portal| UMS
    UMS -->|Verifies credentials per Tenant| ExternalAuth
    UMS -->|Routes traffic & enforces Tenant isolation| Downstream
```

---

### Level 2: Container Diagram
Maps the physical subsystems (React Frontend, NestJS API, PostgreSQL Database) that make up the monorepo and how they communicate using secure protocols.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Clients["Client Applications"]
        ReactApp["Frontend React Web App (Lazy-loaded Portal)"]
        MobileApp["Future Mobile App (iOS/Android)"]
    end

    subgraph Gateways["BFF Gateways"]
        WebBFF["Web BFF Gateway (Express/NestJS)"]
        MobileBFF["Mobile BFF Gateway (Payload Optimizer)"]
    end

    subgraph Server["Application Services (Tenant Isolated)"]
        NestAPI["RESTful NestJS Service (UMS Core / TMS / WMS)"]
        PostgresDB["PostgreSQL 16 Database (Shared Schema + RLS)"]
    end

    ReactApp -->|1. HTTPS / JWT + Tenant Header| WebBFF
    MobileApp -->|1. HTTPS / Optimized Payload| MobileBFF
    WebBFF -->|2. Internal TCP / gRPC| NestAPI
    MobileBFF -->|2. Internal TCP / gRPC| NestAPI
    NestAPI -->|3. Sets LOCAL tenant context| PostgresDB
```

### Level 3: API Component Diagram
An interactive zoom into the **NestJS API** structure, demonstrating the flow of control towards the core (*Inversion of Control*) of the Hexagonal Architecture.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph HTTP["External Adapters Layer (HTTP)"]
        Controller["UserController (HTTP Controller)"]
    end

    subgraph Application["Use Cases Layer (Application)"]
        UseCase["RegisterUserUseCase (Business Use Case)"]
        DTO["RegisterUserDto (Validation)"]
    end

    subgraph Core["Domain Core Layer (Core)"]
        UserEntity["User Entity (Pure Business Entity)"]
        IUserRepo["IUserRepository (Persistence Port)"]
        IPassHasher["IPasswordHasher (Hashing Port)"]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure["Persistence Adapters Layer"]
        TypeOrmRepo["TypeOrmUserRepository (Persistence Adapter)"]
        BcryptHasher["BcryptPasswordHasher (Hashing Adapter)"]
    end

    Controller -->|Invokes| UseCase
    UseCase -->|Validates input with| DTO
    UseCase -->|Instantiates and creates| UserEntity
    UseCase -.->|Depends on| IUserRepo
    UseCase -.->|Depends on| IPassHasher

    TypeOrmRepo -.->|Implements| IUserRepo
    BcryptHasher -.->|Implements| IPassHasher
