# 🗺️ Master Navigation Map - UMS Knowledge Base

Welcome to the master technical documentation for the **User Management System (UMS)**. This knowledge base is structured under the **bMAD Method (numerical sequential phases)** to guarantee maximum discoverability, traceability, and seamless support for both human developers and autonomous AI copilots.
