# 🔬 Product Scope & Boundaries - User Management System (UMS)

## 1. In-Scope Capabilities
The User Management System (UMS) manages the following key functional capabilities:

### A. Organization & Multi-Tenancy Governance
- Definition of **Organizations (Tenants)** and their hierarchical structures.
- Strict database isolation using **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)**.
- Delegated administration: allows tenant admins to manage their own local users and assignments.

### B. Granular Authorization & Profile Engine
- Management of **Client Systems** registering to UMS.
- Real-time compilation of the hierarchical **Permission Graph** for users.
- Management of **Policy Templates** that attach reusable authorization blocks to multiple profiles.
- Strict **Explicit-Deny Precedence** rule processing at the core authorization engine.

### C. Dynamic UI Layout Injection
- Dynamic metadata schemas for **Menus, Options, and Actions** mapped to system roles.
- APIs exposing customized navigation structures to clients based on active permissions.

### D. Immutable Business Auditing
- Automatic tracking of all critical data mutations (creation, modification, deletion of users/roles) using database subscribers.
- Secure, isolated, and immutable audit logs.

### E. Administrative UMS Web Portal (Policy Administration Point - PAP)
- **Central Control Panel**: Dynamic maintenance (CRUDs) of Organizations (Tenants), Systems, Menus, Submenus, Options, Profiles, and Roles.
- **Active Session & Telemetry Monitors**: Real-time auditing of authentication attempts, cache hit ratios, and Redis-cache evictions.
- **Visual Graph Resolver**: Interactive visualization of the compiled authorization graph for specific user/tenant contexts (e.g., debugging Transportation Analyst permissions).

## 2. Out-of-Scope Capabilities
To prevent scope creep and keep the UMS highly specialized, the following domains are strictly **Out-of-Scope**:

- **Sovereign User Store / Password Hashing**: UMS does not store password hashes or perform local credentials verification. This is delegated 100% to Zitadel.
- **Billing and Subscription Management**: Credit card processing, tenant invoicing, and subscription tier limits are managed by a separate Billing microservice.
- **Direct Mail/SMS Gateways**: Delivery of notifications or verification messages is delegated to Twilio/SendGrid adapters; UMS only triggers the events.
- **Transactional Domain Operations**: Core operations of downstream applications (such as TMS freight planning or WMS warehouse stock) are completely isolated from UMS.
