## 2. Backlog Detailed View (User Stories & Technical)

### Epic 1: Core Multi-Tenant Isolation

#### **US-101: Login & JWT Issuance**
* **Description:** As a sandbox user, I want to authenticate myself to obtain a secured Bearer Token.
* **Type:** Functional
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
 * Payload MUST explicitly host `sub` (userId) and `tenantId`.
 * Returns 401 Unauthorized upon credential mismatches.
* **Priority:** Must Have

#### **TS-103: [Technical] Row-Level Security (RLS)**
* **Description:** As an Architect, I demand the DB layer executes `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant'))` policy to safeguard data.
* **Type:** [Technical]
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
 * A naked Query executed without explicit `WHERE` clauses returns exclusively context-relevant rows.
* **Priority:** Must Have

### Epic 2: Hexagonal Task Lifecycles

#### **US-201: Validated Task Registration**
* **Description:** As a user, I want to log a new to-do task to maintain tracking.
* **Type:** Functional
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
 * Domain rules trigger a validation error BEFORE DB interaction if title length exceeds 150 chars.
* **Priority:** Must Have

#### **TS-203: [Technical] Domain Events Pub/Sub (In-Memory)**
* **Description:** As a Developer, I want the creation flow to broadcast a `TaskCreated` message via injected event bus.
* **Type:** [Technical]
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
 * The transactional application use case emits the event without static awareness of the handlers.
* **Priority:** Should Have

## 3. Evolution Roadmap & Planned Technical Debt

Subsequent Technical Tickets are locked until execution parameters scale based on [ADR-0045](../../../architecture/adrs/core/0045-microservice-extraction-readiness-criteria.md):

* `TS-302 [Phase 2]` - **Transactional Outbox:** Guaranteeing delivery consistency amid downstream outages.
* `TS-401 [Phase 3]` - **Dapr Sidecar Extraction:** Orchestrating the service mesh transition.

> **Scrum Master Note:** All listed stories satisfy **INVEST** hygiene norms and are cleared for direct execution in the very first sprint cycle of the Sandbox.
