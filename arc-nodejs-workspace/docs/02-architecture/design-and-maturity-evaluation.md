# 📊 Design Maturity & Patterns Evaluation — Microservices & Progressive Evolution

This document presents a rigorous evaluation of international **Microservices Patterns and Anti-patterns** measured against our current progressive monolithic architectural design. It serves as a strategic guide to de-risk the long-term technical evolution.

## ⚖️ 1. Global Pattern Maturity Matrix

This matrix rates our current infrastructure and design readiness against standard enterprise patterns.

| Pattern Cluster | Specific Pattern | Applicability to Current Stack | Maturity / Risk Score | Implementation Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integration** | **Strangler Fig** | **Critical Core** | 🟢 100% Ready | The foundational strategy of the architecture. Modules are logically isolated for incremental microservice splitting without service downtime. |
| **Composition** | **BFF (Backend for Frontend)** | **Core Mandatory** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Officially implemented via specialized NestJS layers per device (ADR-0008). Prevents cross-channel pollution. |
| **Reliability** | **Circuit Breaker** | **Operational** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Implemented via **Distributed Circuit Breakers** sharing state via Redis (ADR-0011) combined with active upstream healthcheck monitoring at Kong Ingress Edge. |
| **Database** | **Schema Per Context** | **Core Mandatory** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Solves coupling from day one. Prevents raw SQL join poisoning across domains (ADR-0031). Zero-refactor DB portability. |
| **Scalability** | **CQRS (Basic)** | **High Value** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Formally governed via Matrix (ADR-0034). Applied as aggregate Read-Models at BFF and isolated storage for high contention. |
| **Consistency** | **Saga Pattern** | **Distributed Future** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Formal Strategy established (ADR-0035) utilizing Choreography/Orchestration mechanics tailored to workflow size. |
| **Messaging** | **Transactional Outbox** | **High Criticality** | 🟢 100% Adopted | Mandated via ADR-0033. Guarantees absolute atomic consistency between DB state and RabbitMQ event forwarding via outbox relay table. |

**Score Legend:**
*   🟢 **Adopted**: Fully designed, verified in specs, zero configuration changes required.
*   🟡 **Roadmap**: Infrastructure handles it natively, implementation depends on future module complexity.
*   🔴 **Incompatible**: Blocked by current infrastructure choice (None currently identified).

## 🚫 2. Critical Anti-Patterns and Preventive Immunization

Our architecture intentionally deploys specific "antibodies" to guarantee we don't devolve into traditional legacy architectures.

### 2.1 The "Distributed Monolith" Anti-pattern
*   **Risk**: Microservices coupled via synchronous network calls where failure in Service A crashes Service B automatically.
*   **Our Immunization**:
    1.  **Async Inter-Context Events (ADR-0015)**: Domain boundaries interact via agnostic event emission, not direct dependency chains.
    2.  **Hexagonal Boundaries (ADR-0002)**: Logic lives isolated inside pure TypeScript entities, preventing direct cross-border import smuggling.

### 2.2 The "Shared Database Entanglement" Anti-pattern
*   **Risk**: Multiple microservices running SQL joins across each other’s internal tables, making internal schema evolution impossible.
*   **Our Immunization**:
    1.  **Strict Multi-Schema Isolation (ADR-0031)**: Even though data sits on the same PostgreSQL instance today, no cross-schema SQL joins are ever allowed in application logic. Database connections are scoped contextually.

### 2.3 The "Fat Controller / Smart Pipe" Anti-pattern
*   **Risk**: Logic accumulates inside API Gateways (Kong) or Message Buses, making changes complex and untestable.
*   **Our Immunization**:
    1.  **Dumb Pipes / Smart Endpoints**: The Bus just passes messages. Kong just routes and authenticates. ALL logic remains trapped in Domain/Application layers where full Jest testing maintains sovereignty.

### 2.4 The "Log Shards" (Blindness) Anti-pattern
*   **Risk**: Log streams scattered across servers with zero ability to trace a user action across the distributed flow.
*   **Our Immunization**:
    1.  **OpenTelemetry Distributed Tracing (ADR-0007)**: Strict enforcement of `TraceParent` transmission through Kong -> BFF -> Core -> PostgreSQL ensures a unified diagnostic graph.

## 🚀 3. Final Maturity & Risk Assessment

### 🛡️ Resiliency Strength: **HIGH**
*   The insertion of native **Circuit Breakers (ADR-0011)** and the strict contract testing regime shields the backend from total failure if external systems collapse.
*   **Dual-Layer Isolation (ADR-0010)** creates mathematically provable security containment for Multi-Tenancy.

### ⚡ Performance Overhead: **LOW/OPTIMIZED**
*   **4-Tier Caching** (Client -> CDN -> BFF -> Core) handles read intensity intelligently before reaching raw disk.
*   gRPC implementation for heavy internal backbones prevents the overhead of JSON/HTTP negotiation cascades.

### 🚧 Remaining Risks / Immediate Action Recommendations
To reach the highest level of International Architecture Maturity, the roadmap should prioritize:
1.  **Formalizing the Transactional Outbox Pattern**: To guarantee that synchronous database writes NEVER lose corresponding asynchronous Event Bus messages if the Broker falls down momentarily.
2.  **Contract Testing Expansion**: As new gRPC payloads expand, strictly enforcing **Pact JS** rules protects context evolution safety.
